# Task 2

There will be two main types of nodes on the network --- the key manager, and
the clients. The user will have to manually start the key manager, read the
port of the key manager, and start the clients.

The key manager will have a thread that will continuously listen to any input
from clients on it's socket. The input will either be: 

1. A message from a client saying that it is ready to accept new instructions,
   along with it's IP address and port and desired chunk size
2. A result from a client stating the key range, and a valid key if it found
   one.

If the manager receives the first kind of message, it will dispatch a key range
to search to the given IP and port. The client will then search this range and
send the second kind of response back.

When the manager receives the second kind of message and the key is found, the
manager will print out a success message to standard output and exit, leaving
the clients to finish their work and timeout sending a message to the manager.
A response back to the client is not required because the clients will request
more work.
