/**
 * This parallel merge sort using futures will be faster than the sequential
 * merge sort on a machine where some other cores/threads are available (they
 * aren't currently being used). This has very little typing overhead in
 * comparison to the sequential merge sort - sort(firstHalf) becomes
 * ForkJoinPool.common().submit(Callable { sort(firstHalf) }) - which is not
 * much extra typing. Using the common pool reduces the overhead of creating
 * new threads, except maybe when starting the program when the pool may not
 * have been used yet. I learned that you can avoid creating your own thread
 * pool by using the common fork join pool (by accidentally discovering it).
