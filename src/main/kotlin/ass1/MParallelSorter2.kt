/**
 * To fork join pool uses a work stealing algorithm so there will be less
 * overhead creating lots of new threads if threads get blocked. This algorithm
 * is almost identical to the first parallel sort algorithm, except for the
 * work stealing that is used by the fork join pool. I learned that i probably
 * should not have used the common pool for the first merge sort algorithm, in
 * case one part of the program submits a lot of work to be done and another
 * part of the program submits a tiny bit of work - the tiny bit of work may
 * not be done for a long time (i believe this is called starvation).
