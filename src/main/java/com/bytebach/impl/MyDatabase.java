public class MyDatabase implements Database {
	// This is where you'll probably want to start. You'll need to provide an
	// implementation of Table as well.
	//
	// One of the key challenges in this assignment is to provide you're
	// own implementations of the List interface which can intercept the various
	// operations (e.g. add, set, remove, etc) and check whether they violate
	// the constraints and/or update the database appropriately (e.g. for the
	// cascading delete).
	//
	// HINT: to get started, don't bother providing your own implementations of
	// List as discussed above! Instead, implement MyDatabase and MyTabe using
	// conventional Collections. When you have that working, and the web system
	// is doing something sensible, then consider how you're going to get those
	// unit test to past.
