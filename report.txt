## What the code does and doesn't do ##

NOTE: I used the framework Google Guice

The [x] symbols are a ticked checkbox.
This list is copied from the marking schedule page

Minimum out of 30:
- [x] The program reads the data and draws a map.
- [x] (15) It constructs a graph structure using collections of intersections, segments, and roads.

Core out of 35 (up to 65):
- [x] (15) The map can be zoomed and panned, and the user can select intersections with the mouse,
and some details are shown.
    - [x] Show location and roads that go through this intersection
- [x] (10) Road names can be entered into the text box and all segments are highlighted on the map.
Can be either exact or prefix matches, check that all segments highlighted.
- [x] (5) The names of all roads joining the selected intersection are outputted, without duplicates.
- [x] (5) The graph (not exhaustive search) is used to find the roads joining a selected intersection.
Getting from node to segment to road should be constant time.

Completion out of 20 (up to 85):
- [x] (15) Correct code for a trie structure, with methods to add an element and find all elements
with a given prefix.
- [x] (5) Trie is used to output the names of all roads which match a prefix in the search box, as well
as highlighting them on the map. If the prefix exactly matches a road name, only output and
highlight road(s) of that name.

Challenge out of 15 (up to 100 max, with 5 spare marks here):
- [x] (5) A quad-tree structure is used to quickly find intersections near a mouse click.
- [x] (5) The quad-tree retrieves the closest intersection in all cases.
- [x] (5) The polygon data is used to draw a nice map with lakes, parks, airports, a coastline, etc.
    - Some of the polygons look weird for some unknown reason, even though most
    of the polygons are fine
- [x] (5) The GUI is improved, with one of mouse-based panning and zooming or adding a drop-down
suggestion box to the search bar.
    - I added mouse panning and zooming, not the drop-down suggestions

## Data structures used ##

I started by storing the RoadInfo, Node (intersections) and RoadSegment objects
in ArrayLists (and each type is basically used as a struct), and then optimised
things a little bit - I used a lot of HashMaps for things like looking up a
RoadInfo by its id.

The Graph contains a HashMap of a generic NodeInfoT type to Node (to maintain a
strong reference to the nodes, and to provide fast lookup of the nodes assuming
that the data stored in each node is unique). A Node can be created without
being connected to anything (so that edges can be added to it later) but the
edges have to be connected to nodes while it is instantiated (to avoid
mutability).

The Trie for the looking up RoadInfo objects by their label (street name) was a
tree structure (each Trie node had a HashMap of the next character to another
Trie node) and each Trie node had a Collection of RoadInfo. The absence of
RoadInfo data in a Trie meant that that Trie represents the middle of a string.
I kept this Trie as generic as I could just for fun, so any CharSequence could
be used as "keys" and any type of data could be stored in the Trie. I could
have made Trie implement Map<CharSequence,RoadInfo>, but the implementation
would have to be a bit more complex to make the implementation transparent to
the outside. Getting a list of the results with a custom limit could also be
tricky.

The QuadTree was used for finding a Node nearest to an arbitrary point (where
the user clicked). I implemented it similar to a binary search tree where each
Section (I called the nodes sections because they divide data into subsections)
has 4 subsections (rather than 2 in a binary search tree) and a piece of data
itself. I kept this structure generic also (just in case I might need to use it
in some other situation) so used a generic data type and comparators to figure
out which subsection a new piece of data should belong to. Finding the nearest
point was trickier because it required some recursive thinking, but it ended up
being O(n) because it compares the shortest distance to the closest node in all
subsections (which requires comparing against every single data point). I
should have made it more efficient by checking whether a point within a section
exists, then I know not to check the other sections. That would hopefully make
it closer to O(log n).

Basically all of the data structures can be found as a field in the
main.mapdata.MapData class.

## Testing ##

I tested the program by doing a semi-Test-Driven Development style. I wrote a
test for parsing the data (and some other tasks) followed by an implementation
to pass the test. I then repeated this. I only did this TDD style for places
where there can be quite a bit uncertainty: parsing files, (it would be
difficult to find bugs when parsing a large file because it would be hard to
find what part was causing the problem); and potentially complex-to-debug data
structures like a QuadTree or a Trie. I had a problem with the QuadTree and I
wrote additional tests to help me debug.

I used thorough, manual testing to make sure every feature I wrote worked - I
wrote small features and then tested them to make sure it worked, rather than
writing a large amount of stuff.

There are 2 bugs difficult-to-debug that I know about. The first is that some
polygons appear to have points that cause the area to overlap itself (causing
some strange visual effects). My data parsing works fine (passes my tests, and
manual checking, and works fine for most polygons), but for some reason it
happens on the odd polygon. I have no idea why this happens. Secondly, the map
sometimes disappears when moving around the map. This doesn't happen often at
all so it is even harder to debug. I guess this is due to multithreading and
mouse-event handling (which could cause the program to think the mouse was
dragged really far away).
